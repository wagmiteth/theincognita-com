  <h1>How to establish a Network State?</h1>
  <i>
    Almost everywhere you can find Nodes of people or information. Few of these
    have the capability for collective action to build a new country and
    eventually gain diplomatic recognition. But we believe some of you have,
    these are the suggested stages for you. This article is inspired by Balaji
    Srinivasan's book <a href="https://thenetworkstate.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
       The Network State
    </a>

  <h2>Gather a Startup Society</h2>
  <p>
    To start a network state, the first step is to gather a startup society.
    This is a community of people who share a common interest in building
    something greater. The society can be founded by anyone with aspirations for
    something new, just like founding a company or a cryptocurrency. The
    founder's legitimacy comes from whether others opt to follow them.
  </p>
  <h2>Organize a Network Union</h2>
  <p>
    Once a sufficiently dedicated online community has been formed, the next
    step is to organize it into a network union. Unlike a social network, a
    network union has a purpose: it coordinates its members for their mutual
    benefit. Unionization is a key step because it turns an otherwise
    ineffective online community into a group of people working together for a
    common cause.
  </p>
  <h2>Crowdfund a Network Archipelago</h2>
  <p>
    After organizing the network union, the next step is to crowdfund a network
    archipelago. This involves building trust offline and a cryptoeconomy
    online. Begin holding in-person meetups in the physical world, of increasing
    scale and duration, while simultaneously building an internal economy using
    cryptocurrency. Once sufficient trust has been built and funds have been
    accumulated, start crowdfunding apartments, houses, and even towns to bring
    digital citizens into the physical world within real co-living communities.
    Link these physical nodes together into a network archipelago, a set of
    digitally connected physical territories distributed around the world. Nodes
    of the network archipelago range from one-person apartments to in-person
    communities of arbitrary size. Physical access is granted by holding a web3
    cryptopassport, and mixed reality is used to seamlessly link the online and
    offline worlds.
  </p>
  <h2>Diplomatic Recognition Network State</h2>
  <p>
    As the network state scales, run a cryptographically auditable census to
    demonstrate the growing size of your population, income, and real-estate
    footprint. A startup society with sufficient scale should eventually be able
    to negotiate for diplomatic recognition from at least one pre-existing
    government, and from there gradually increased sovereignty, slowly becoming
    a true network state. The key idea is to populate the land from the cloud,
    and do so all over the earth. The people are spread around the world in
    clusters of varying size, but their hearts are in one place.
    <br />
    <br />
    To summarize, the process of starting a network state involves gathering a
    startup society, organizing it into a network union, crowdfunding a network
    archipelago, and gaining diplomatic recognition. This process is unique in
    that it begins in the digital world and materializes into the physical
    world. By starting with an online community, the network state can be
    ideologically aligned but geographically decentralized. It allows people to
    work together for a common cause without being limited by physical
    boundaries.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The network state concept is also different from traditional ways of
    starting a new country. Instead of winning sufficient power in an election,
    conducting a political revolution, or winning a war, the network state takes
    the most robust existing tech stack we have, namely the suite of
    technologies built around the internet, and uses it to route around
    political roadblocks, without waiting for future physical innovation.
    <br />
    <br />
    In conclusion, the network state is a peaceful, reproducible process for
    turning an online community premised on a proposition into a physical state
    with a virtual capital. It is a new kind of fractal polity with its capital
    in the cloud. The network state is a powerful idea that could change how we
    think about starting new countries and societies. It has the potential to
    create a world where people can build something new without historical
    constraints, and where the brand new is not unthinkable, but an achievable
    reality.
